    React Apollo GraphQl fixed
  </styled.h1>
  <styled.p>
    The third version of minimal react apollo boilerplate. I was learning GraphQl several years ago. However, I couldn't find many react-apollo examples. The situation changed a lot since then, but I am trying to keep this repository alive. There is never enough of simple examples. I hope this one will make learning Apollo and GraphQl easier for you.

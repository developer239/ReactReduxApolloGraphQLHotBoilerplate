    <H2>React Redux Apollo Graphql</H2>
    <P>
      The third version of this minimal react apollo boilerplate. Originally this application was
      created a couple of years ago when I was learning GraphQl but couldnâ€™t find many high-quality
      resources. The situation changed a lot since then but I am trying to keep this repository
      alive.

      If you want to learn graphql I highly recommend this website:
      <A href="https://www.howtographql.com"> https://www.howtographql.com</A>

      You can find the source code of this application
